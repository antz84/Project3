# Quizztastic
## Project 3

## User Interactivity
- Each quiz question is displayed in a fresh page, together with either multiple choice answers or a text input answer form.
- Once a particular quiz answer is chosen it is highlighted in some way.
- Then, either a next button appears, or the next question will be loaded automatically after a short delay.
- Upon completion of all questions the final score will be displayed. All questions will be displayed along with their answers, and coloured green or red for correct and incorrect answers respectively.

## Technologies Used
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript / jQuery
* Flexbox
Git
* Github Pages (hosting)
* Trello (workflow)
* Atom (text editor)
* Chrome (dev tools)
* Butchers paper (wireframe sketches)

### Project Brief
__Overview__

You will build a pure front-end quiz game. The game should support answers as both multiple choice and free text entry. Once a player completes the quiz, they should be able to see their score out of the maximum possible outcome.

__Technical Requirements__

Your app must:
* Render a game in the browser
* Have a flexible number of questions along with their answers
* Design logic for winning & visually display score.
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

__Necessary Deliverables__

* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo. This must be placed inside of your_username.github.io in a folder called project1. It will then be accessible via http://your_username.github.io/project1/
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. We strongly encourage you to work our of the repository your_username.github.io
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* Suggested Ways to Get Started
