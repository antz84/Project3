# Trivia Time
## Project 3

## Technologies Used
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript / jQuery / Git / Trello
* Atom / Chrome / Paper (wireframe)

### Project Brief
__Overview__

You will build a pure front-end quiz game. The game should support answers as both multiple choice and free text entry. Once a player completes the quiz, they should be able to see their score out of the maximum possible outcome.

__Technical Requirements__

Your app must:
* Render a game in the browser
* Have a flexible number of questions along with their answers
* Design logic for winning & visually display score.
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

__Necessary Deliverables__

* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo. This must be placed inside of your_username.github.io in a folder called project1. It will then be accessible via http://your_username.github.io/project1/
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. We strongly encourage you to work our of the repository your_username.github.io
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
